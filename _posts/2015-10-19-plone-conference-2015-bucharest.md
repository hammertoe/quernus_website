I've not been involved in Plone much in the past year. After organising the annual Plone Conference in Bristol last year, and after leaving Netsight to work on something different, I needed a mental break for a bit. I've been involved with Plone for nearly 15 years now, and that is quite a long time working with the community and evangelising the wonders of Open Source content management.

So I wasn't going to be going to Plone Conference this year. My current main client, enquos, uses Plone for their online help centre, but it is not something I am directly involved with. So the justification of me going to the conference this year was not that strong...

...but...

The strangest thing happened a few months ago. My wife, Vik, who has been a 'Plone widow' for a number of years, putting up with me jetting off to far corners or the globe to attend Plone events saw a conversation between two Plone community members, Cris Ewing and Kim Nguyen talking about the upcoming conference in Bucharest. She has met a number of the community at events when I've dragged her along (OK, so not much dragging needed to get her to Sorrento for Plone Open Garden).

"I want to go to the Plone Conference" she said "I miss these people"

Stockholm Syndrome.

"Really? I we could go anywhere on holiday" I replied.
"Yes, but I only see these people a few times a year and I like them"

So I thought I'd submit a talk for the conference, and that would decide if we go or not. It got accepted. So we booked flights and hotel to go to the conference with a view that it would be part conference and part holiday.

I think it certainly says a lot about a community that one's spouse misses them as much as you do. In fact, by the end of the conference the joke was that it was Vik that would be invited to the next conference, and perhaps Mr Vik would tag along too ;)

So a few weeks later we were driving to Luton airport to fly to Bucharest. Alas, no direct flights from Bristol to Bucharest. We could have flown to Budapest and then got the train, which would have been quite fun, but also take more time that I wanted to take off.

Bucharest is a beautiful city. There are so many impressive old buildings, and very welcoming people.
