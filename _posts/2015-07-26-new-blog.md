title: Introducing New Blog
---

So it has been ages since I had a blog. I used to blog on the Netsight blog whilst I was there, but I've been up a lot of exciting change since then 
and needed somewhere to start posting interesting stuff I've been working on. So this is it :)

For 15 years I’ve been working on some pretty heavy duty Python-based web systems and content management systems such as Plone. So I thought I’d try something very different. I wanted something extremely lightweight that would allow me to just do some very simple blogging and have a presence online.

I looked at a number of static website generation systems, and in the end settled on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and starting with a simple foundation for [Poole](http://getpoole.com/).
