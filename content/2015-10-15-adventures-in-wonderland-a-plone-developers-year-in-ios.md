I just gave a talk at the Plone Conference 2015 in Bucharest. 

After 15 years of working purely in Python, I was thrown head-first into the world of iOS development. Taking over the management of a mobile app being developed for a Python web application, I've had to deal with managing iOS developers, understanding the iOS ecosystem, and working out Apple's byzantine procedures and processes.

The slides for the talk, and the screencast video are below
