Zope Page Templates have been around for a while, and used extensively
in Zope and many Zope based apps and frameworks, but did you know you
can use ZPT with any Python project? Indeed there are implementations of
the syntax used, Template Attribute Language (TAL), for other languages
too. Making it one of the most portable, cross platform templating
languages there is. Find out why ZPT and TAL are so elegant, and how to
use them with your Python project.

I will cover why TAL is a great choice for templating, the simple syntax
of TAL and how to create and render page template objects in your code.
