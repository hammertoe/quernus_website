A bit of a different format for BathCamp in June. We’ll be cage
fighting.

No.

Actually, it’s a sort of follow on from our previous BathCamp – a
comparison of as many CMS systems as we can get people to talk about.

Obviously any comparison of CMS system is heavily caveated with an “it
depends…” but nonetheless we think it’ll be interesting to hear from
people talking about the good, the bad and the ugly of the systems they
use.

The format of the talks will be “5 things I love about this CMS and 5
things I hate”, followed by time for questions and general CMS-like
banter.

We’ve got the following lined up:

WordPress

Drupal

Expression Engine

Plone

PyroCMS

Perch

Umbraco

Defacto
