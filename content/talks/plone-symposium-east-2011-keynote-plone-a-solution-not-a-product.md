Abstract: Looking at the market for content management systems, there
are a whole slew of products out there, both proprietary and Open
Source. Typically people choose a product from a vendor and then have to
find a implementation company to implement it for them. With Plone the
implementation company \*is\* the vendor. But unlike proprietary
single-vendor solutions, Plone has hundreds of companies and individuals
worldwide that can help you implement Plone. Sometimes we take for
granted just what an amazing community we have and its diversity both
geographically and in different industries. In this keynote I am going
to look at Plone and its use around the world and the community that
makes it so special
