This was a talk I gave at the [SWMobile Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/swmobile/events/233768799/) in Bristol in October 2016. The talk was a lightning talk on automating the new Xcode 8 automated signing system when using it in a CI setup.
In our case we use it with Jenkins and Fastlane to automate all our builds.
