The advantages of Open Source systems go beyond simple cost savings.
Content management by its very nature requires a significant level of
customisation and integration to meet business requirements. By not
prohibiting the inspection and modification of the source code, Open
Source enables a level of flexibility not available with proprietary
systems.

This talk will present a case study of the process one corporation,
Belron®, went through in the development of a corporate Intranet based
on Plone. Belron® is the world’s largest vehicle glass repair and
replacement company, owning some of the best known brands in the
industry including Carglass®, Autoglass®, O’Brien® and Safelite®.
Belron® employs more than 19, 500 people working in 28 countries
worldwide.

In this talk you will see how the flexibility of Open Source allowed an
initial modest Intranet to adapt and grow over time to an organisation’s
evolving requirements, and the development of multiple sub-sites,
specific business processes and multilingual support. You will also see
how Open Source’s licensing model allows un-fettered growth and
deployment of the Intranet to multiple countries.
