I was invited to give a talk at the Rotary Club Bristol about Plone. I
spoke about the community and how an amazing group of people world wide
gather across locations around the globe to develop software... and have
a few beers in the process.

Iâ€™m afraid the audio quality is not that great, but hopefully you can
turn the volume up and bit and still hear me
