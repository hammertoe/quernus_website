A lightning talk I gave at the PyData Bristol meetup on 20th Sept 2018. This is a talk about some experiments I have been doing trying to predict cryptocurrency price movements using a type of machine learning algorithm called a Convolutional Neural Network -- the same sort of AI used by computers to be able to 'see' a cat or a dog in a photo. In this case applied to market microstructure data on a cryptocurrency orderbook.
