Belron International is the global parent company of brands such as
Autoglass and Carglass. With a turnover of nearly €3bn, they employ
25,000 people in 32 countries, repairing or replacing a windscreen every
3 seconds.

In 2007 the organisation developed an intranet based on the Open Source
CMS Plone. This year the intranet was extended and re-focussed to add a
range of social media functions to integrate with (and enhance) the
existing suite of content management and workflow tools.

Over 5 years the intranet has evolved to provide features that are used
on a daily basis by all functions within the organisation. The challenge
with the introduction of ’social’ content creation and collaboration has
been to manage and integrate these new ways of working into established
processes.

In this talk we will show how a large, multinational organisation has
overcome the common concerns relating to social media in the enterprise,
including governance, loss of control and the risks of reliance on
services outside the firewall. Once these concerns are mitigated, the
social media model can be used to drive employee engagement and increase
effective communication across the business.

You will hear about their top 5 tips to successfully deploying a social
intranet, illustrated by real examples of these techniques in practice.
