summary: A look at the last three years of my work in numbers.
---

I am coming to the end of three years of working on a long running contract on a 'quantified self' system for a client, [enquos](https://www.enquos.com/). This is a system to help people measure and track their nutrition, exercise and wellbeing in order to effect change in their life. It has been a fascinating three years, but gave me an idea for a blog post: Some of the numbers of the last three years of some of the work I've been doing. Both for enquos, and also side-projects I've been working on.

So here we go...

I've been working on enquos for **1117 days**. In that time I built our mobile development team from scratch and I have found/hired/managed a total of **12 developers**. We have built **6 apps** in total across both iOS and Android platforms. I set up a continuous integration test and build server that has started at least **3876 complete signed, distributable builds of the apps**. 

The iOS app has been developed over **two languages** (Swift and Obj-C) and **three major version of Xcode** (7,8 9). 

Between the Android and iOS versions of the latest app 'enquos Total Health', we have over **1250 automated tests**.

The final iOS app take approx **37 minutes to build, test, package and deploy**. The Android app takes approx **8 minutes to build test, package, and deploy**. So assuming we built the same number for each, and over the life of the app the build time average is half the final time, then the build server has spent a total of **31 days** solid building the app. Our build numbering system changed halfway through, so I reckon that 3876 is only half the number of builds we have done. And the total time and number of builds is likely double that, more like **2 months** solid building.

I introduced Slack into the company and in that time there have been a total of **324,964 messages** sent on Slack between us.

When I first started, the iOS app I inherited from an outsourced app development company in another country, was over **1 GB in size**. It is now **84 MB**, yet still retains a complete offline searchable database of nutrition items. Each entry containing up to **160 different nutrients**.

In this time I have given **five talks** at **3 conferences and 2 user groups**. I have also given **four talks** at schools and universities as a STEM Ambassador.

I now know more about iOS app signing and provisioning profiles than any sane human should.

In other projects, I built the Python back end for a budget simulation game for a UN conference on sustainable development. The game was used by **450 people** at the conference over **3 days** and processed a peak of **10,000 financial transactions per second**. It was a collaboration between **three** different companies, one doing the mobile apps, one the overall idea and strategy and myself doing the backend.

I have also stared to learn Node.js and get more interested in cryptocurrencies. Specifically, the real-time settlement network, Ripple. You know how an international SWIFT payment takes four days to complete? Ripple does the same in **4 seconds**. So fast, you can actually try and make money foreign exchange trading by sending currency back and forth across the network. I wrote a bot to do just that, which is currently trading **Â£1.2 million per month** between **eight currency pairs**. And making a small profit in the process.

Oh, and I've lost **10kg** in weight in this time.
